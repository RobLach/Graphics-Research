# Personal Graphics Research

Mostly archiving some personal graphics research projects as I get around to cleaning them up. Various implementations of SIGGRAPH papers for fun and some stuff ripped from discarded game projects.

## 2d Dynamic Lighting
Implementing a point lighting system in a 2D graphics rendering pipeline by using a heightmap for each sprite in addition to a color map to create a dynamic shading/shadowing system.
